Summary of Online Voting System Project

The Online Voting System is a modern C++ project designed to replace traditional, time-consuming voting methods with a fast, secure, and accessible digital platform. It empowers users to cast votes safely by verifying personal details like CNIC, age, and mobile number — ensuring one person, one vote.
Through this system, voters choose between major political parties — TLP, PTI, PMLN, and PPP — and get real-time vote counts, party-wise results, and a clear winner display. The entire process is automated, transparent, and secure from fraud or duplication.
Built entirely using C++, the project also reflects the team's learning journey — from understanding object-oriented logic to tackling memory handling challenges. It highlights real-world issues like accessibility, privacy, and election transparency, while also pointing toward future improvements in both the programmer's skills and the technology itself.
